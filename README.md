# TDS Project 1

This is the first project of TDS course of IITM BS Degree Programme. In this programme, we have to scrap data from Github and do analysis on it and submit the answers to the questions given in the project.

- I have used Python for scraping the data and used **multiprocessing** for faster scraping especially for repositories. You can check the detailed scraping code in [data_loading.ipynb](./data_loading.ipynb) file.
- While doing [analysis](./data_analysis.ipynb), I found out that most devs doesn't have the company/org name, which represents that either they are solo devs and their leader strength is comparatively less.
- An advice for developers is to contribute to open source projects, join communities and work in a team to get more experience and learn from others.


### Extras
- I have 2 branches in this repository, one is `main` (default) and other is `dev`. I have used `dev` branch for the whole project and pushed necessary files in `main` branch. If you want to see the `dev` branch, you can switch to it.
    ```bash
    git checkout dev
    ```
